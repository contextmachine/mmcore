## About

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are equations that describe phenomena involving changes that depend on more than
one independent variable, such as time and space. They play a critical role in a variety of scientific disciplines,
including physics, engineering, and economics. The equations involve multiple derivatives and can describe complex
systems in the natural and social sciences.

PDEs can often be complex and hard to solve analytically. Therefore, numerical methods are often used to approximate
solutions. The module provides numerical implementations using forward, backward, and central differencing methods.

For additional information on PDEs, you can visit the following resources:

1. **Wikipedia** entry on [Partial Differential Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation):
   This page provides a general overview of PDEs, including their definition, classification, and numerous examples of
   physical phenomena that can be described by PDEs.

2. **MIT OpenCourseWare**
   offers [courses on Differential Equations](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/index.htm),
   which cover topics like first-order scalar equations, linear scalar equations, and systems of linear equations.

3. **Khan Academy** has a series on [Differential Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations),
   which includes several practical examples and clear explanations. This is a great resource for those wanting to start
   learning about Differential Equations.

4. **Paul's Online Math Notes**
   covers [Partial Differential Equations](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/PDEIntro.aspx) as part of its
   Differential Equations class. The notes are detailed and are aimed at novices to the subject.

5. **The Wolfram MathWorld** entry
   on [Partial Differential Equations](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartialDifferentialEquation.html) offers a
   mathematical perspective with detailed formulas and proofs.

Remember, the resources above cover a wide range of topics associated with PDEs, not all of which may be applicable to
this module. Use them as a general reference for understanding the underlying theory behind the computational methods
implemented in this module.
